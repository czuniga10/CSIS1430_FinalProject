            <p>I am so <span id="noun1"></span> as I am attending my first <span id="noun2"></span> <span id="noun3"></span> baseball game! 
            I am <span id="verb1"></span> right behind home plate and can shout <span id="noun4"></span> at the <span id="adj1"></span> umpire. 
            Before the game started, I got a <span id="noun5"></span> and a couple of <span id="noun6"></span> from the concession stand. On my way back to my seat, 
            I ran into <span id="noun13"></span>, the team's mascot. He put his <span id="noun7"></span> around me and we took a picture! 

            During the <span id="adj2"></span> baseball game, there were <span id="noun8"></span> home runs hit. 
            I also got a signed baseball from <span id="noun9"></span>. During the 7th inning stretch, 
            they played <span id="noun10"></span> over the speakers. Once the game was over, I got to go on the field and 
            <span id="verb2"></span> the bases. I had the best time and canâ€™t wait to attend another. 
            The final score ended up being <span id="noun11"></span> to <span id="noun12"></span>.</p>
