            <p>I went to the <span id="noun1"></span> zoo today with <span id="noun2"></span>. We saw a
            <span id="noun3"></span>, a <span id="noun4"></span>, and a <span id="noun5"></span>. The <span id="adj1"></span> 
            otters put on a <span id="verb1"></span> show for the audience. There was 
            also a <span id="adj2"></span> snake who ate a <span id="adj3"></span> mouse. When I saw the snake, 
            it made me <span id="verb2"></span> out of my shoes. On our way out, we passed by a <span id="adj4"></span> 
            monkey. He flung <span id="noun6"></span> at us and was extremely <span id="noun7"></span>. I have 
            <span id="noun8"></span> pictures of my trip to the zoo!</p>
